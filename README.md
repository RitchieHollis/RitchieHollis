- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RitchieHollis
Currently learning C++ with intention to become a dev someday and some Python 4fun.
19 yo/ Belgium-Poland

Always finding a pleasure while exploring and learning new stuff, always excited in collaborating for interesting projects (not now, but in the future. It's always nice to develop
new skills and gaining experience)
